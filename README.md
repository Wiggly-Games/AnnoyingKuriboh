# Description
This is a Discord Bot that generates random text trained on a data set of all of Weird Al's song lyrics. When added to a server, the server administrators are able to control trigger phrases within that server that the bot will respond to. Once it sees one of these phrases, it'll respond with a randomly generated phrase tagging that user.

# Global Install
The application also supports Global Installs. In this mode, it provides a "/generate" command which allows you to generate a random phrase on command. The data set uses the same data as you'd see inside of a server, so that you're able to send it to all of your friends across different servers.
